# Official RileyCraft Rules

## Chat Rules

1) No Hackusating. This means: Accusing a player of hacking (having an unfair advantage) is against the rules. If you believe someone is hacking, tell Chew or Riley immediately.<br/>
2) Death wishes (or "preferring", or "suggesting") are strictly forbidden. Saying terms such as, but not limited to, "kys", "go die", "i prefer you dead", will result in a mute.<br/>
3) Racism/Sexual misconduct is not allowed. Saying stuff like "omg i hate girls, too fat" will result in mute. This is mostly assumed but severe conducts are immediately muted.<br/>
4) Bypassing your mute in any way (namely irc) will result in a temp-ban in place of the mute time. E.g. if you were muted for 10 minutes and you bypassed, your remaining time will be as a temp-ban. It's pretty easy to tell that you've bypassed a mute on IRC, and if your account is known, it will be muted on IRC as well.<br/>
5) Bullying is not allowed. Being mean to someone specifically in chat will result in a mute. No punishments will be given if players are just joking around with one another.<br/>
6) Do not spam the chat. Saying 3 messages in the span of 5 seconds counts as spam. This also includes saying the same message 3 or more times in a 2 minute period.<br/>
7) Disrespecting staff in any way, such as accusing of abuse, hacking, breaking rules, etc, will result in a mute at the staff's discretion.<br/>
8) NO ADVERTISING! If an IP is said in chat, the mute AND ban chart will be bypassed and a ban will be issued. If a server name is said in chat, a mute chart mute will be issues. If a user is suggesting to go to that server (e.g. "Hey wanna join mineplex?") may result in a ban chart ban.<br/>
9) Impersonating Staff/YouTubers in any way will result in a ban chart ban.<br/>
10) Selling items outside of the server (like alts, etc) will bypass the ban chart and result in a permanent ban.<br/>

## Playing Rules

All rules except rule 1 go immediately to the ban chart.

1) No Hacking, this includes: Flying, speed mining, x-ray, kill aura, force field, or regen. Anything not stated on this list is not explicitly not allowed but can still be punished if it gives the player an unfair advantage. This rule bypasses the Ban Chart and is a perm ban. All hacking is based on the banning mod's opinion and knowledge of hackers <br/>
2) If a player enters combat (a player attacks another player, or vice versa) neither of the players may log out for 10 seconds after the last attack, nor may they enter a Non-PvP (safe) zone, this includes: Teleporting away (although ender pearls are allowed). This ban wears off until combat is not enabled (10 seconds after the last attack)<br/>
3) Using an alt to help with your main account (e.g. using an alt to mine stuff while your main idles at a farm) is against the rules. Using an alt is allowed if no interaction between the main and the alternate accounts occurs. If caught, the alt will be banned permanently.
